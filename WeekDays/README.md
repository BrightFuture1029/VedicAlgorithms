# WeekDays

 Each planet rises every hour in east. 
 Where Saturn (Shani) being the slowest and Moon being the fastest.
 As Per Hora names for days are given based on the planet that rises first on east.

Algo:
 1 Day = 24 Hour
 Rahu and Ketu being the shadow panets, so they wont be considered.
 This leavs us with 7 planets => 'Shani','Guru','Mangal','Ravi','Shukra','Budh','Chandra'
 These are arranged from very slow to very fast w.r.t. earth.
 Lets Start from Saturday (Shaniwar):
 
 On  Saturday first star to rise is Saturn (Shani), then Guru and so on.
 Total planets 7, so 7x3 => 21 this leaves 3 hours to go.
 Third from Shani is Ravi, hence Raviwar (Sunday)
 If we continue with this we get following pattern:

Shani,Guru,Mangal ->
Ravi,Shukra, Budh ->
Chandra,Shani,Guru ->
Mangal,Ravi,Shukra ->
Budh,Chandra,Shani ->
Guru,Mangal,Ravi ->
Shukra,Budh,Chandra
																										 
- Shani (Saturn) -> Shanivar (Saturday)
- Guru (Jupiter) -> Guruwar (Thursday)
- Mangal (Mars) -> Mangalwar (Tuesday)
- Ravi (Sun) -> Raviwar (Sunday)
- Shukra (Venus) -> Shukrawar (Friday)
- Budh (Mercury) -> Budhwar (Wednesday)
- Chandra also called Soam  (Moon) -> Soamwar (Monday)
